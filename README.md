# Circular Flow Economy with RL Agents

## TODO List:

* Utility function for people
* Utility function for firms
* Matching algorithm for goods: given actions for both firms and people, assign money and inventory 
* Matching algorithm for labor:


* Define states and actions for RL algorithm, and potentially separate RL algorithm into a class
* RL for each person
* RL for each firm
