# Circular Flow Economy with RL Agents

## TODO List:
* Data structure to store actions
    * every action, for firm or person, will consist of one "demand curve" and one pair (price, number of hours to work) or (price, number of goods to sell)
    * store in Action class, but not sure how to store the demand curve yet
* Utility function for people (what parameters are getting passed in)
* Utility function for firms
* Matching algorithm for goods: given actions for both firms and people, assign money and inventory 
* Matching algorithm for labor:


* Define states and actions for RL algorithm, and potentially separate RL algorithm into a class
* RL for each person
* RL for each firm
